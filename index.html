          The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's
          dominant software platform. It is an information space where documents
          and other web resources can be accessed through the Internet using a
          web browser. The Web has changed people's lives immeasurably. It is
          the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact on the
          Internet. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and
          opened to the public in 1991.
